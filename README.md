# The Polycule Project

## Goal

To represent the relationships of awesome polyamorous people in graph form and
show how beautifully connected we all are, with proper respect for privacy and
personal identity.

This project was inspired by the gorgeous and complex charts maintained by
[Alex Temple] and [Ray Briggs].  Their work has defined the requirements for
early iterations:

1. **(MVP)** Display the data represented by _Lexi's Polycule Graph_, with a
basic password-locked admin interface for updates and private dissemination.
2. Add additional dimensions to display the data represented by _Ray's Polycule
Graph_, with options to change the visualization.  Allow anonymized public
views and notifications of updates.
3. Allow logins from people whose contact info has been given, and give them
the ability to maintain their own personal information and connections.

Further requirements shall be defined as needed.
